04.- Attention: XML Feed of User Properties: We highly encourage you not to work with XML feed. We rather encourage you to interact
     directly with our API endpoints. Please note that we do not provide any support for XML feed, and will be deprecating it in 2022.
     However, if you still choose to operate with this feed, please see the URL below:
